# Dr.Diary 

![clipart](desktop/Dr-Diary/public/images/journal.png)

## Purpose of Application
Medications are currently prescribed on a trial and error basis to patients. Depending on the type of medication and its half-life it can potentially take years to identify the proper med and dosage for that patient. Dr.Diary allows patients to track their prescriptions and make daily journals (free writing) and notes (specified by Dr) that their Dr has access to - providing LIVE data for the health care professional. The more relevant data means a quicker identification process!
